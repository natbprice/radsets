### Overview

The **radsets** package creates Radial Sets diagrams for visualizing
overlapping sets.

### When to use radial sets to visualize data

Radial sets are useful for visualizing relationships among variables
which have many features in common. When the number of variables is
small, simple venn diagrams can be useful (e.g.Â Figure
@ref(fig:venDiag)).

![Example of a simple overlapping set using a venn
diagram.](README-vennDiag-1.png) However, when the number of pairwise
interactions is high, identifying patterns may be too difficult using
simple visualizations (e.g., Fig. @ref(fig:vennDiag2)). ![Example of a
more complicated overlapping set using a venn
diagram.](README-vennDiag2-1.png)
