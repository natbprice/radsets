### The Problem

The **radsets** package is a solution to the problem of how to visualize
large overlapping sets. In particular, when analyzing data with many
overlapping sets it is difficult to draw insight from a Venn diagram.
Moreover, it may be impossible to draw a Venn diagram that accurately
reflects the size of set intersections.

The solution implemented in the **radsets** package is a based on Radial
Sets diagrams (see references). Radial Sets diagrams are an interactive,
network-based visualization for the analysis of ovarlapping sets.

### MovieLens Example

#### Radial Sets Diagram

The [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/)
includes 19 genre attributes for 27,000 movies. A Radial Sets diagram
created with the **radsets** package is shown below. The width of the
links indicate the percent overlap (normalized by union) between each
movie genre. The link color indicates the relative difference between
the observed overlap and the expected overlap assuming marginal
independence. The link color palette is diverging blue to red with red
indicating overlaps that are larger than expected. The bars in each
sector indicate the number of items unique to each set, shared with one
other set, shared with two other sets, or shared with three or more
other sets. The set locations on the circumference have been optimized
using the **radsets** package to place similar sets closer together,
thereby minimizing length of thickest links.

#### Venn Euler Diagram

Radial sets are useful for visualizing relationships among variables
which have many features in common. When the number of variables is
small, simple venn diagrams can be useful. However, when the number of
pairwise interactions is high, identifying patterns may be too difficult
using simple visualizations. Moreover, it may not be possible to draw a
venn diagam that accurately represents the overlap between sets. Here we
use the [venneuler](https://cran.r-project.org/package=venneuler)
package to illustrate the problem with using Venn diagrams when we are
interested in many overlapping sets.

Radial Sets diagrams were originally proposed by Alsallakh, Aigner,
Miksch, and Hauser. The **radsets** package is unaffiliated with these
researchers and the visualizations produced differ slightly from the
original design.
