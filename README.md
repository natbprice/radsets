### When to use radial sets to visualize data

Radial sets are useful for visualizing relationships among variables
which have many features in common. When the number of variables is
small, simple venn diagrams can be useful. However, when the number of
pairwise interactions is high, identifying patterns may be too difficult
using simple visualizations. Moreover, it may not be possible to draw a
venn diagam that accurately represents the overlap between sets
